# Improved eBay pages (Chrome Extension by CDL)

CDL were a team consist of 6 students aiming to add and modify user interface on eBay website. The team made a Chrome Extension modifying eBay user interface and add features such as price comparison and product review which were taken from other websites. Furthermore, we used agile methodology to boost effectivity and shorten response time to changes.

This is a google chrome extension which improved eBay User Interface and give some functionality for the customer ease of use. These key features are the result of our discussion and compromises made after we started the project. There are many ideas that we wanted to put in the key features but after long discussions those ideas were reassigned to a low priority list. Below are some low priority features:
1. Remove all upselling and cross-selling
2. Remove all advertisements on page
3. Comparing itemâ€™s price from other websites
4. Give third party review of the product
5. Modify UI to be more customer-friendly
6. On and off button in extension popup
7. Feedback form from user
